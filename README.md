This is just a little script to setup a test environment for Telegraf (Influxdb) with Prometheus and its Alertmanager. Furthermore Grafane will be installed.

Its designed to run on an Ubuntu(16.04 Xenial) VM.

At the end you should be able to access

### Grafana:
- ip:3000
- admin:1234

### Prometheus:
- ip:9090

### Alertmanager:
- ip:9093
